### HW1
Index is starting from 0 upto 99, so the cache mean and standard deviation are calculated at indexes 99, 89, 79...9

In order to run it on the terminal, do the following:<br>
`$ python3 hw1.py > out.txt`

### HW2
Consists of 2 files:
1. hw2.py
2. cleanData.py

#### Running Instructions:
output1 > Run cleanData.py <br>
output2 > Run cleanData.py <br>
output3 > Run hw2.py <br>

### HW3
The output file is broken into two parts on the same code: <br>
Output1.txt consists of part 1 of homework 3. <br>
Output2.txt consists of part 2 of homework 3. <br>
Data used is table.csv file

#### Important note!
The output in output2.txt may be different in format from expected since the code is done such a way that the columns have header calues as '?' are removed and a new table is generated all together. Thus, column indexes printed are not exact to the sample  but the logic is same and correct.

### HW4
The output file is: <br>
zeroR_output1.txt consists of output of weathernom.txt. <br>
zeroR_output2.txt consists of output of diabetes.txt. <br>
NB_output1.txt consists of output of weathernom.txt. <br>
NB_output2.txt consists of output of diabetes.txt. <br>
Data used is weathernom.csv file and diabetes.csv

### HW5
The output file is: <br>
output1.txt consists of output of y with nums. <br>
output2.txt consists of output of y with entropy. <br>

### HW6
the output file is: <br>
auto.txt consists of the output for auto.csv file <br>
diabetes.txt consists of the output for diabetes.csv <br>
To run the file:
Uncomment the part in main.py for diabetes.csv to run the decisionTree function <br>
Uncomment the part in main.py for auto.csv to run the regressionTree function
python3 main.py

### HW7
the output file is: <br>
pom310000.txt consists of the output for pom310000.csv <br>
xomo10000.txt consists of the output for xomo10000.csv <br>

### HW8 
the output file is: <br>
trees.md
rowsBestRest.md
Comment.md
Comment2.md
To run the program for rowsBestRest do -> python3 main.py
To run program for trees.md, uncomment lines 83-86 in main.py and run -> python3 main.py

#### Note
You can see from the output that the values obtained for pd, false alarms in zeroR are very low and relatively higher for Naive Bayes. This is because ZeroR does not take recall very well whereas Naive Bayes considers it.<br>

To run the program, enable data in the main function and run the loop for the given data and classifier.
