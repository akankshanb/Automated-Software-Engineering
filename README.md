### HW1
Index is starting from 0 upto 99, so the cache mean and standard deviation are calculated at indexes 99, 89, 79...9

In order to run it on the terminal, do the following:<br>
`$ python3 hw1.py > out.txt`

### HW2
Consists of 2 files:
1. hw2.py
2. cleanData.py

#### Running Instructions:
output1 > Run cleanData.py <br>
output2 > Run cleanData.py <br>
output3 > Run hw2.py <br>

### HW3
The output file is broken into two parts on the same code: <br>
Output1.txt consists of part 1 of homework 3. <br>
Output2.txt consists of part 2 of homework 3. <br>
Data used is table.csv file

#### Important note!
The output in output2.txt may be different in format from expected since the code is done such a way that the columns have header calues as '?' are removed and a new table is generated all together. Thus, column indexes printed are not exact to the sample  but the logic is same and correct.

### HW4
The output file is: <br>
Output1.txt consists of output of weathernom.txt. <br>
Output2.txt consists of output of diabetes.txt. <br>
Data used is weathernom.csv file and diabetes.csv
