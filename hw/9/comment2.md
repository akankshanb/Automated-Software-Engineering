Suvodeep in his paper "Learning GENERAL Principles from Hundreds of Software Projects" in Section 2.1 and Section2.2 states reasons to seek stable general conclusions in
software engineering. He talks about Generality, Trust, Insight, Training and Tool development.

* Under Generality, he mentions that it is imperitive to hold general conclusions that hold across multiple projects
* Under Trust he emphasizes the change in the model makes managers lose faith in software analytics
* Under Insight, he mentions that the aim of software analytics is to obtain actionable insights that help practitioners
accomplish software development goals
* Under training, Majumder stresses that if models are not stable, then it hard to teach what factors most
influence software quality
* At last, under Tool development, he says that it is difficult to design and implement and deploy tools if they are unsure what factors most influence quality

We agree with Suvodeep's thoughts too. The advantages of generalization exceed its disadvantages. The more training data, the better the learned model which establishes that if the conclusions are drawn from one model, we expect the conlcusions to remain the same for other project models too.
Moreover, this will build trust among other developers which help in getting insights that can help in future work. Global reasoning can maintain uniformity and is easier to teach data miners new into this field. However, if there is large data where global reasoning was used, there is not much attention to which features determined this conlcusion. Sometimes, more specific information is required which can be helpful from reasoning which conforms to a local level.
